Week 4 day 4 Cybersecurity & Cryptography Lab

In this lab, I implemented password hashing for a signup/login page and tested it using Postman. I also created my own cipher algorithm and conducted research on major cybersecurity breaches. Throughout the lab, I enjoyed encrypting and deciphering messages, acquiring valuable skills in cybersecurity and cryptography.
